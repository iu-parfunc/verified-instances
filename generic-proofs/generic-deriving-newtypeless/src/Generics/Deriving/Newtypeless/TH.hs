This module contains Template Haskell code that can be used to
automatically generate the boilerplate code for the generic deriving
library.

To use these functions, pass the name of a data type as an argument:

@
&#123;-&#35; LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell &#35;-&#125;

data Example a = Example Int Char a
$('deriveAll0'     ''Example) -- Derives Generic instance
$('deriveAll1'     ''Example) -- Derives Generic1 instance
$('deriveAll0And1' ''Example) -- Derives Generic and Generic1 instances
@

On GHC 7.4 or later, this code can also be used with data families. To derive
for a data family instance, pass the name of one of the instance's constructors:

@
&#123;-&#35; LANGUAGE FlexibleInstances, TemplateHaskell, TypeFamilies &#35;-&#125;

data family Family a b
newtype instance Family Char x = FamilyChar Char
data    instance Family Bool x = FamilyTrue | FamilyFalse

$('deriveAll0' 'FamilyChar) -- instance Generic (Family Char b) where ...
$('deriveAll1' 'FamilyTrue) -- instance Generic1 (Family Bool) where ...
-- Alternatively, one could type $(deriveAll1 'FamilyFalse)

{- $options
'Options' gives you a way to further tweak derived 'Generic' and 'Generic1' instances:

* 'RepOptions': By default, all derived 'Rep' and 'Rep1' type instances emit the code
  directly (the 'InlineRep' option). One can also choose to emit a separate type
  synonym for the 'Rep' type (this is the functionality of 'deriveRep0' and
  'deriveRep1') and define a 'Rep' instance in terms of that type synonym (the
  'TypeSynonymRep' option).

* 'KindSigOptions': By default, all derived instances will use explicit kind
  signatures (when the 'KindSigOptions' is 'True'). You might wish to set the
  'KindSigOptions' to 'False' if you want a 'Generic'/'Generic1' instance at
  a particular kind that GHC will infer correctly, but the functions in this
  module won't guess correctly. For example, the following example will only
  compile with 'KindSigOptions' set to 'False':

  @
  newtype Compose (f :: k2 -> *) (g :: k1 -> k2) (a :: k1) = Compose (f (g a))
  $('deriveAll1Options' False ''Compose)

{- $make

There are some data types for which the Template Haskell deriver functions in
this module are not sophisticated enough to infer the correct 'Generic' or
'Generic1' instances. As an example, consider this data type:

@
newtype Fix f a = Fix (f (Fix f a))
@

A proper 'Generic1' instance would look like this:

@
instance Functor f => Generic1 (Fix f) where ...
@

Unfortunately, 'deriveRepresentable1' cannot infer the @Functor f@ constraint.
One can still define a 'Generic1' instance for @Fix@, however, by using the
functions in this module that are prefixed with @make@-. For example:

@
$('deriveMeta' ''Fix)
$('deriveRep1' ''Fix)
instance Functor f => Generic1 (Fix f) where
  type Rep1 (Fix f) = $('makeRep1Inline' ''Fix [t| Fix f |])
  from1 = $('makeFrom1' ''Fix)
  to1   = $('makeTo1'   ''Fix)
@

Note that due to the lack of type-level lambdas in Haskell, one must manually
apply @'makeRep1Inline' ''Fix@ to the type @Fix f@.

Be aware that there is a bug on GHC 7.0, 7.2, and 7.4 which might prevent you from
using 'makeRep0Inline' and 'makeRep1Inline'. In the @Fix@ example above, you
would experience the following error:

@
    Kinded thing `f' used as a type
    In the Template Haskell quotation [t| Fix f |]
@

Then a workaround is to use 'makeRep1' instead, which requires you to:

1. Invoke 'deriveRep1' beforehand

2. Pass as arguments the type variables that occur in the instance, in order
   from left to right, topologically sorted, excluding duplicates. (Normally,
   'makeRep1Inline' would figure this out for you.)

Using the above example:

@
$('deriveMeta' ''Fix)
$('deriveRep1' ''Fix)
instance Functor f => Generic1 (Fix f) where
  type Rep1 (Fix f) = $('makeRep1' ''Fix) f
  from1 = $('makeFrom1' ''Fix)
  to1   = $('makeTo1'   ''Fix)
@

On GHC 7.4, you might encounter more complicated examples involving data
families. For instance:

@
data family Fix a b c d
newtype instance Fix b (f c) (g b) a = Fix (f (Fix b (f c) (g b) a))

$('deriveMeta' ''Fix)
$('deriveRep1' ''Fix)
instance Functor f => Generic1 (Fix b (f c) (g b)) where
  type Rep1 (Fix b (f c) (g b)) = $('makeRep1' 'Fix) b f c g
  from1 = $('makeFrom1' 'Fix)
  to1   = $('makeTo1'   'Fix)
@

Note that you don't pass @b@ twice, only once.

Note [Forcing buildTypeInstance]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, we don't explicitly need to generate a Generic(1) type instance, but
we force buildTypeInstance nevertheless. This is because it performs some checks
for whether or not the provided datatype can actually have Generic(1) implemented for
it, and produces errors if it can't. Otherwise, laziness would cause these checks
to be skipped entirely, which could result in some indecipherable type errors
down the road.

Note [Substituting types in constructor type signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While reifyConTys gives you the type variables of a constructor, they may not be
the same of the data declaration's type variables. The classic example of this is
GADTs:

  data GADT a b where
    GADTCon :: e -> f -> GADT e f

The type variables of GADTCon are completely different from the declaration's, which
can cause a problem when generating a Rep instance:

  type Rep (GADT a b) = Rec0 e :*: Rec0 f

Naïvely, we would generate something like this, since traversing the constructor
would give us precisely those arguments. Not good. We need to perform a type
substitution to ensure that e maps to a, and f maps to b.

This turns out to be surprisingly simple. Whenever you have a constructor type
signature like (e -> f -> GADT e f), take the result type, collect all of its
distinct type variables in order from left-to-right, and then map them to their
corresponding type variables from the data declaration.

There is another obscure case where we need to do a type subtitution. With
-XTypeInType enabled on GHC 8.0, you might have something like this:

  data Proxy (a :: k) (b :: k) = Proxy k deriving Generic1

Then k gets specialized to *, which means that k should NOT show up in the RHS of
a Rep1 type instance! To avoid this, make sure to substitute k with *.
See also Note [Generic1 is polykinded on GHC 8.2].

Note [Arguments to generated type synonyms]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A surprisingly difficult component of generating the type synonyms for Rep/Rep1 is
coming up with the type synonym variable arguments, since they have to be just the
right name and kind to work. The type signature of a constructor does a remarkably
good job of coming up with these type variables for us, so if at least one constructor
exists, we simply steal the type variables from that constructor's type signature
for use in the generated type synonym. We also count the number of type variables
that the first constructor's type signature has in order to determine how many
type variables we should give it as arguments in the generated
(type Rep (Foo ...) = <makeRep> ...) code.

This leads one to ask: what if there are no constructors? If that's the case, then
we're OK, since that means no type variables can possibly appear on the RHS of the
type synonym! In such a special case, we're perfectly justified in making the type
synonym not have any type variable arguments, and similarly, we don't apply any
arguments to it in the generated (type Rep Foo = <makeRep>) code.

Note [Polykinded data families in Template Haskell]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to come up with the correct instance context and head for an instance, e.g.,

  instance C a => C (Data a) where ...

We need to know the exact types and kinds used to instantiate the instance. For
plain old datatypes, this is simple: every type must be a type variable, and
Template Haskell reliably tells us the type variables and their kinds.

Doing the same for data families proves to be much harder for three reasons:

1. On any version of Template Haskell, it may not tell you what an instantiated
   type's kind is. For instance, in the following data family instance:

     data family Fam (f :: * -> *) (a :: *)
     data instance Fam f a

   Then if we use TH's reify function, it would tell us the TyVarBndrs of the
   data family declaration are:

     [KindedTV f (AppT (AppT ArrowT StarT) StarT),KindedTV a StarT]

   and the instantiated types of the data family instance are:

     [VarT f1,VarT a1]

   We can't just pass [VarT f1,VarT a1] to buildTypeInstanceFromTys, since we
   have no way of knowing their kinds. Luckily, the TyVarBndrs tell us what the
   kind is in case an instantiated type isn't a SigT, so we use the stealKindForType
   function to ensure all of the instantiated types are SigTs before passing them
   to buildTypeInstanceFromTys.
2. On GHC 7.6 and 7.8, a bug is present in which Template Haskell lists all of
   the specified kinds of a data family instance efore any of the instantiated
   types. Fortunately, this is easy to deal with: you simply count the number of
   distinct kind variables in the data family declaration, take that many elements
   from the front of the  Types list of the data family instance, substitute the
   kind variables with their respective instantiated kinds (which you took earlier),
   and proceed as normal.
3. On GHC 7.8, an even uglier bug is present (GHC Trac #9692) in which Template
   Haskell might not even list all of the Types of a data family instance, since
   they are eta-reduced away! And yes, kinds can be eta-reduced too.

   The simplest workaround is to count how many instantiated types are missing from
   the list and generate extra type variables to use in their place. Luckily, we
   needn't worry much if its kind was eta-reduced away, since using stealKindForType
   will get it back.

Note [Kind signatures in derived instances]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We generally include explicit type signatures in derived instances. One reason for
doing so is that in the case of certain data family instances, not including kind
signatures can result in ambiguity. For example, consider the following two data
family instances that are distinguished by their kinds:

  data family Fam (a :: k)
  data instance Fam (a :: * -> *)
  data instance Fam (a :: *)

If we dropped the kind signature for a in a derived instance for Fam a, then GHC
would have no way of knowing which instance we are talking about.

Another motivation for explicit kind signatures is the -XTypeInType extension.
With -XTypeInType, dropping kind signatures can completely change the meaning
of some data types. For example, there is a substantial difference between these
two data types:

  data T k (a :: k) = T k
  data T k a        = T k

In addition to using explicit kind signatures on type variables, we also put
explicit return kinds in the instance head, so generated instances will look
something like this:

  data S (a :: k) = S k
  instance Generic1 (S :: k -> *) where
    type Rep1 (S :: k -> *) = ... (Rec0 k)

Why do we do this? Imagine what the instance would be without the explicit return kind:

  instance Generic1 S where
    type Rep1 S = ... (Rec0 k)

This is an error, since the variable k is now out-of-scope!

Although explicit kind signatures are the right thing to do in most cases, there
are sadly some degenerate cases where this isn't true. Consider this example:

  newtype Compose (f :: k2 -> *) (g :: k1 -> k2) (a :: k1) = Compose (f (g a))

The Rep1 type instance in a Generic1 instance for Compose would involve the type
(f :.: Rec1 g), which forces (f :: * -> *). But this library doesn't have very
sophisticated kind inference machinery (other than what is mentioned in
Note [Substituting types in constructor type signatures]), so at the moment we
have no way of actually unifying k1 with *. So the naïve generated Generic1
instance would be:

  instance Generic1 (Compose (f :: k2 -> *) (g :: k1 -> k2)) where
    type Rep1 (Compose f g) = ... (f :.: Rec1 g)

This is wrong, since f's kind is overly generalized. To get around this issue,
there are variants of the TH functions that allow you to configure the KindSigOptions.
If KindSigOptions is set to False, then generated instances will not include
explicit kind signatures, leaving it up to GHC's kind inference machinery to
figure out the correct kinds.

Note [Generic1 is polykinded on GHC 8.2]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prior to GHC 8.2, Generic1 :: (* -> *) -> Constraint. This means that if a Generic1
instance is defined for a polykinded data type like so:

  data Proxy k (a :: k) = Proxy

Then k is unified with *, and this has an effect on the generated Generic1 instance:

  instance Generic1 (Proxy *) where ...

We must take great care to ensure that all occurrences of k are substituted with *,
or else the generated instance will be ill kinded.

On GHC 8.2 and later, Generic1 :: (k -> *) -> Constraint. This means we don't have
to do this kind unification anymore! Hooray!
